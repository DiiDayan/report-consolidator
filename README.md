## Data format

Your CSVs need these columns (tool auto-detects variations):

**Required:**
- `impressions` (or `views`)
- `clicks`
- `spend` (or `cost`)
- `conversions` (or `sales`)

**Optional:**
- `platform` - for cross-platform comparison
- `campaign` - for campaign-level analysis
- `date` - for time analysis

Column names are flexible. The tool handles common variations automatically.

- **CPA** (Cost Per Acquisition): `spend / conversions`
