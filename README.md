## üìÅ Data Format

Your CSV files should include these columns (common variations are auto-detected):

**Essential:**
- `impressions` (or `views`, `impress`)
- `clicks`
- `spend` (or `cost`, `amount`)
- `conversions` (or `sales`, `conv`)

**Recommended:**
- `platform` (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc.) - for cross-platform comparison
- `campaign` - for campaign-level analysis
- `date` - for time-series analysis

**The tool automatically:**
- Normalizes column names (handles variations)
- Detects and groups by platform
- Calculates all relevant KPIs
- Generates insights

## üìà Use Case Example

### The Problem
You run a Winter Sale campaign across three platforms:
- Facebook Ads ‚Üí `facebook_ads_jan.csv`
- Google Ads ‚Üí `google_ads_jan.csv`
- LinkedIn Ads ‚Üí `linkedin_ads_jan.csv`

Each platform gives you different CSV formats. You need to:
- See total performance across all platforms
- Compare which platform is most cost-effective
- Decide where to allocate more budget

### The Solution
1. Upload all three CSV files to the tool
2. Get instant consolidated view with calculated KPIs
3. See insights like "Google has lowest CPC but LinkedIn has best conversion rate"
4. Make data-driven budget decisions

**Time saved:** From hours of spreadsheet work to seconds.
