# Marketing Performance Consolidator

Consolidate ad data from Facebook, Google, LinkedIn (and others) into one place. Automatic KPI calculation + campaign-level statistics included.

## What it does

Takes multiple CSV files from different ad platforms and:

- Merges them into one dataset
- Calculates standard marketing KPIs (CTR, CPC, CPA, conversion rate, CPM)
- Shows campaign-level statistics (mean, median, std dev, ranges)
- Identifies best/worst performing campaigns
- Generates performance comparisons across platforms
- Points out what's working and what isn't

Two ways to use it:
- **Web interface**: Upload files, see results, download reports
- **Command line**: Drop CSVs in a folder, run script

## Why this exists

Marketers running campaigns on multiple platforms waste time:
- Downloading CSVs from each platform
- Copy-pasting into spreadsheets
- Manually calculating KPIs
- Making comparison charts
- Figuring out which campaigns actually perform well

This automates it. Upload ‚Üí Get analysis ‚Üí Done.

Charts comparing KPIs across platforms.

## Expected data format

Your CSVs or Excel files need these columns (tool auto-detects variations):

**Required:**
- `impressions` (or `views`)
- `clicks`
- `spend` (or `cost`)
- `conversions` (or `sales`)

**Optional:**
- `platform` - for cross-platform comparison
- `campaign` - for campaign-level analysis
- `date` - for time analysis

Column names are flexible. The tool handles common variations automatically.

## Metrics calculated

- **CTR** (Click-Through Rate): `(clicks / impressions) √ó 100`
- **CPC** (Cost Per Click): `spend / clicks`
- **CPM** (Cost Per Mille): `(spend / impressions) √ó 1000`
- **CPA** (Cost Per Acquisition): `spend / conversions`
- **Conversion Rate**: `(conversions / clicks) √ó 100`
- **ROAS** (if revenue data): `revenue / spend`

Plus statistical distribution (mean, median, std dev, min/max) for each metric when multiple campaigns exist.
